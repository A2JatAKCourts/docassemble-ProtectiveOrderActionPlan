The "certificate" tells the court how you are giving a copy of all the documents you file with the court to ${ other_party_in_case }. If the form does not have a **Certificate of Service**, use **Certificate of Service, TF-700 [Fill-In PDF](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/tf-700.pdf)**.
  4. File your documents with the court using TrueFiling. Include a copy of the **Certificate of Service**.
  5. If you do not fill out the Certificate of Service:

    * The court will send you a **Deficiency Notice**, and
